If they don't respond positively, I think I would take some time to process my emotions and talk to people who do understand me, like Tanisha or my academic advisor.\n\nI've also been making an effort to prioritize self-care, like taking breaks and doing things I enjoy, like working on my game development projects or going for a walk. I find that these activities help me clear my head and stay focused on my goals. I've also been trying to practice self-compassion by being kinder to myself and not beating myself up over things that are outside of my control.\n\nAnother strategy that might help me stay motivated is to set small, achievable goals for myself, and celebrate my progress along the way. That way, even if my parents aren't fully on board, I can still see that I'm making progress and moving forward with my passions. I think having a support system in place, like my coding club and friends who share similar interests, will also help me stay motivated and encouraged.\n\nBut I have to admit, it's still hard for me to imagine not getting my parents' full support and understanding. It's something I'll have to work on, I guess \u2013 learning to be okay with not having their immediate approval, and still pursuing my passions with confidence and resilience."

That way, I'll have a support system that understands and appreciates my passion, even if my parents might not... (hesitate) yet.

Instead of beating myself up over mistakes or unfinished projects, I'm trying to acknowledge the effort I'm putting in and the steps I'm taking towards my goals.

I've realized that taking care of myself physically and mentally will help me stay more balanced and resilient, so I can better handle those setbacks and doubts.

(smiles) I think that's a great way to make self-care feel more enjoyable and sustainable, so I'm going to start experimenting with that.\n\nOverall, it's about being intentional with my time and energy, and making self-compassion a habit, even when it feels like the last thing I want to do."
